# YEAR 1 — WEEK-BY-WEEK TASK PLAN

**Focus:** Programming + Computational Thinking + Math
**Time:** ~15–20 hrs/week
**Rule:** No code written = week not completed

---

## MONTH 1 — Programming Foundations (Python)

### Week 1 — Thinking Like a Programmer[Done]

Tasks:

* Install Python + VS Code
* Write 5 tiny programs:

  * Calculator
  * Temperature converter
  * Even/odd checker
  * Simple interest calculator
  * Number guessing game
* Learn:

  * Variables
  * Input/output
  * Conditionals

Deliverable:

* GitHub repo: `python-basics`
* One README explaining what each program does (simple English)

---

### Week 2 — Loops & Functions

Tasks:

* Write programs using:

  * `for` loops
  * `while` loops
  * functions
* Implement:

  * Fibonacci series
  * Prime number checker
  * Multiplication table generator

Stretch task:

* Rewrite one program *without* using loops (forces thinking)

---

### Week 3 — Data Types & Errors

Tasks:

* Work with:

  * Lists
  * Tuples
  * Dictionaries
* Write a program that:

  * Stores student names + marks
  * Calculates average
  * Finds top scorer

Reality check:

* Intentionally break your code
* Fix errors by reading tracebacks (no Googling first)

---

### Week 4 — Mini Project 1

Project:

* **Console-based Student Management System**

  * Add students
  * Update marks
  * Display results
  * Save/load from file

Rule:

* No copy-paste from internet
* Logic must be yours

---

## MONTH 2 — Computer Science Fundamentals

### Week 5 — Algorithms & Flow

Tasks:

* Draw flowcharts for:

  * Sorting numbers
  * Searching an element
* Implement:

  * Linear search
  * Bubble sort (from scratch)

Explain:

* Write comments explaining *why* each step exists

---

### Week 6 — Time Complexity (Big-O)

Tasks:

* Compare:

  * One loop vs nested loop
* Write two versions of same program:

  * Fast
  * Slow

Goal:

* Feel performance, not memorize theory

---

### Week 7 — Strings & Files

Tasks:

* Read text from a file
* Count:

  * Words
  * Characters
  * Frequency of letters

Mini-project:

* Text analyzer (input file → stats output)

---

### Week 8 — Mini Project 2

Project:

* **File-Based Expense Tracker**

  * Add expenses
  * Categorize
  * Monthly summary

This mimics real-world software, not exam toys.

---

## MONTH 3 — Math for AI (Quietly Brutal)

### Week 9 — Discrete Math & Logic

Tasks:

* Truth tables
* AND / OR / NOT logic in Python
* Write a program that simulates logical gates

Why:

* AI decisions are logic chains wearing fancy clothes

---

### Week 10 — Probability Basics

Tasks:

* Simulate coin tosses (100, 1,000, 10,000)
* Plot outcomes
* Compare expected vs actual probability

Reality lesson:

* Randomness behaves only statistically, not emotionally

---

### Week 11 — Statistics

Tasks:

* Calculate:

  * Mean
  * Median
  * Standard deviation
* Use real data (CSV)
* Visualize results

Tool:

* Python + basic plotting

---

### Week 12 — Semester Project

Project:

* **Data Analysis Project**

  * Choose a dataset (finance, weather, population, sports)
  * Clean data
  * Analyze trends
  * Write conclusions

Deliverables:

* Jupyter notebook
* GitHub repo
* Short report (1–2 pages)

This replaces your “Semester 1 final exam”.
