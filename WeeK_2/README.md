In week 2 projects, I intended to use class oop which is very much complex and advance for me as being beginner. 
But I still tried it and ask chatGPT the context i donot understand something.

In,
    fibonacci_series.py , I used class for the first time and I basically cannot understand the working flow at first but I tried myself by changing variables and lines of code for clarification and I somehow go used to it.
    In that script, I make it user friendly which can n terms of fibonacci series.

    multiplication_table_generator.py , this script and generate the multiplication table of given number and also I used limit which can show
    the limit of that particular table. Like, limit is 5 of table 5 then it will do upto 5x5=25 only.
